# LegaSea: Adventure & Exploration System

## 🌊 Project Overview
LegaSea is a high-fidelity Roblox adventure project that explores the synergy between **immersive environments** and **backend system logic**. 

As a **Cybersecurity student**, I developed this project to test my skills in building robust server-client architectures, ensuring that game state data and player rewards are handled through secure remote events to prevent client-side exploits.

## 🚀 Technical Features
* **Secure Remote Architecture:** Implemented a strict server-authoritative model for discovery and reward systems.
* **Dynamic UI Systems:** Interactive menus that reflect real-time player data.
* **Scalable Codebase:** Modular scripting in Luau for easy expansion of game features.

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Download `LegaSEA copyright.rbxl`.
2. Open with **Roblox Studio**.
3. Ensure **HTTPS Requests** and **API Services** are enabled in Game Settings for full functionality.
4. Press **F5** to run.

## 📁 Repository Structure
* `LegaSEA copyright.rbxl`: Full project environment and assets.
* `/SourceCode`: Key modular scripts for system review.
